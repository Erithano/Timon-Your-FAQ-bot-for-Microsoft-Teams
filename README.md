## Meet Timon
 
Timon [Team on] and Tima [Teama] are AdoptBots for Microsoft Teams.

    They each answer +100 common user questions about... Teams! 😉
    They import into your Power Virtual Agents Teams app (If you follow the guide).
    They help users send questions/feedback to your internal experts.
    And by doing all that, they can save you time and money while users learn Teams.
